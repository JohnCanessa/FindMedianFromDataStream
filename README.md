# FindMedianFromDataStream
LeetCode 295. Find Median from Data Stream in Java
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/

In this problem we are given a class to implement.
We need to come up with the class members and the code
for three methods.

The idea is to add integers and after the first one is 
processed, determine the median and keep on receiving
integers and randomly return the median.

If interested please read the current requirements for
the problem on the LeetCode site.

If interested in my comments and approach, I invite you 
to read the follwoing post in my blog:

Keep in mind that one of the best ways to learn is to read
and experiment, and repeat. Practice makes perfect; at least
that is what I have been told.

Enjoy;
